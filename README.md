Analysis of ADR Equation using PINN
This repository contains the code and resources for solving the Advection-Diffusion-Reaction (ADR) equation using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The project aims to provide an efficient and accurate method for analyzing and simulating complex transport phenomena governed by the ADR equation.

Introduction
The ADR equation is a fundamental equation in fluid dynamics that describes the combined effects of advection, diffusion, and reaction in a physical system. Solving this equation accurately is crucial in understanding various processes such as heat transfer, mass transport, and chemical reactions.

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a powerful approach that combines the flexibility of neural networks with the constraints of known physics equations. By training a neural network to satisfy the ADR equation and associated boundary conditions, we can obtain solutions that accurately represent the behavior of the system.

This project provides a comprehensive implementation of PINNs for solving the ADR equation. It includes the necessary code, example cases, and datasets to facilitate understanding and experimentation.
