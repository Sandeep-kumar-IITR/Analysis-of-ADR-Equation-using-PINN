# Analysis of ADR Equation using PINN

This repository contains the code and resources for solving the Advection-Diffusion-Reaction (ADR) equation using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The project aims to provide an efficient and accurate method for analyzing and simulating complex transport phenomena governed by the ADR equation.


## Introduction
- Advection-diffusion is a mathematical model that describes the transport of a substance in a fluid medium.
- It combines two physical processes:
- Advection, which is the movement of a substance with the flow of the fluid,
- Diffusion, which is the spreading of the substance due to its random motion.
- It also include a chemical or biological reaction that occurs within the transported substance.
- This model is commonly used in environmental engineering, bioengineering, and chemical engineering.

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a powerful approach that combines the flexibility of neural networks with the constraints of known physics equations. By training a neural network to satisfy the ADR equation and associated boundary conditions, we can obtain solutions that accurately represent the behavior of the system.

This project provides a comprehensive implementation of PINNs for solving the ADR equation. It includes the necessary code and analysis of results and errors in taking test cases by different methods.
