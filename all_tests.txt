The Output should always be: 
- The pictures
- The error for each time step
- The predicted coefficients (with error)
- The time needed

We ran Advection-Diffusion and Burgers three times, nonlinear Diffusion once for each setting:

1) First we want to be able to compare with full-batched PDE-Net:
- Test Advection-Diffusion with 	540.000 points with 200.000 runs of ADAM  -- Could only do 400.000 (Out of memory error) with 70.000 runs of ADAM
- Test nonlinear Diffusion with 	540.000 points with 200.000 runs of ADAM  -- Could only do 100.000 (Out of memory error) with 70.000 runs of ADAM
- Test Burgers with 			    360.000 points with 200.000 runs of ADAM  -- Could only do 100.000 (Out of memory error) with 70.000 runs of ADAM

2) Then with a single-batched PDE-Net:
- Test Advection-Diffusion with 	22.500 points with 200.000 runs of ADAM  
- Test nonlinear Diffusion with 	22.500 points with 200.000 runs of ADAM 
- Test Burgers with 			    15.000 points with 200.000 runs of ADAM

3) Compare with Gaussian Processes:
- Test Advection-Diffusion with 	110 points with 200.000 runs of ADAM  
- Test nonlinear Diffusion with 	110 points with 200.000 runs of ADAM 
- Test Burgers with 			    110 points with 200.000 runs of ADAM
